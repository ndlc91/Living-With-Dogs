<h2>The Pros</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Lots of love</li>
    <li>Always have a friend around</li>
    <li>People will love him/her and want to talk to you</li>
    <li>Something to cuddle with at night</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Cons</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Hair everywhere</li>
    <li>Disobedient behavior</li>
    <li>Hogs the bed</li>
    <li>Sometimes <strong><em>pees in the hall</em></strong></li>

</ol>

    <p id="conclusion">In spite of the cons, there is no greater joy than owning a dog.<br>
    I think that the best decision we ever made was to bring home our little bear.
